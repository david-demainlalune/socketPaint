this is a simple and naive test of Paper.js and Socket.io integration

the node app "main.js" serves a simple page with a multi user adaptation of 
the following Paper.js Tutorial example 
-> http://paperjs.org/tutorials/geometry/vector-geometry/

to start serving the test page -> "node main.js"

node requirements:

npm install node-static
npm install socket.io

ruby dependencies (optional):
haml for generating the index.html file
